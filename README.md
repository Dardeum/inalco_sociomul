## Seminar on the sociolinguistics of multilingualism at INALCO
At the beginning of September 2023, I took part in the Sociomul seminar at Inalco. 


## About this seminar
This seminar aims to provide a panoramic view of the fields of study, tools and methodological frameworks available in sociolinguistics to deal with issues of multi or plurilingualism.

## Experimentation
We went for a walk in the 13th arrondissement of Paris on Saturday 02/09/2023 with the idea of taking photos of the neighbourhood's language repertoire in order to analyze it. This repository is an opportunity for me to leave a trace of the courses and my experiments.
